  Hello came back my time! I'm a hacker, and in other words vulnerability researcher 
I have exprienced hacking from 1998~now If do count, Its been about 20 more years
Yeah. But I'm not good at hacking than other my 1337 dudes they online. :~/

1999, I reported the world-around first fsb(format string bug) exploit code, It was a new technique remained to 90's and to now
  (it mean wuftpd-2600.c, I used 'tf8' id nickname before 'x90c')

2002. I joined big famous korean hacker commununity study group(team) OH(OverHead), Not research Code team.
  I studied a script kiddie like style, I was not lame but Think again now, It's just script kiddie level hacker arise the team
  Why?? I was a 1337 whom introduced fsb technique to the internet hacker social
  I can have sayclub.com three bugs reported in 'OH 3th Magazine ('x90c's passion title'd)
  ... ( Muhm ) ...
 
  and etc. etc.

2010~2013, I co-worked researcher for korean security company INETCOP(c) with hacker x82 boss!
